# comp115_project1
This project is a Python turtle drawing for COMP115 Project 1.
I wanted to draw this because i like to draw a ocean view(sunset, or nice ocean view) that has seagulls and clouds.
and also wanted to draw very peaceful one.

However, this program will draw: 
- A sky background
- A sun
- Clouds
- Seagulls in the sky
- Ocean and waves

I have learned how to make clouds, a sun in class.
and also for the other things too(how to make the codes for drawing all the things).
First of all, I changed the background color to make the sky, and make a navy rectangle at the bottom to make ocean.
and then, I have made the sun, using orange(pencolor) and yellow(for the sun inside). and used for i in range(): to make the lines that are surrounding the sun. 

For cloud: i have made 3 white circles, and then, made 4 white circle at the bottom of those 3 circles to make clean clouds.(used (x, y) to place the clouds on the sky.

for wave: I used def draw_shape(): to make the waves(-15, 180) and (15, 180) make the waves connected together and smoothly. and positions on the ocean to make a balanced waves. 

for seagull: i usually draw a seagull like this, so I did similar code with wave and seagull, but with changing the draw_shape(-15, 180) and (15, -180) to make two radius next to eachother.
